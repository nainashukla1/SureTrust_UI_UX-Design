## Overall Learning 

I completed a 6-month UI/UX Design training program at SureTrust, under the guidance of Ghirri Sudhan. During this training period, I developed a strong foundation in UI/UX design principles, including user research, information architecture, wireframing, and high-fidelity UI design. I gained hands-on experience working with design tools like Figma and applied mobile-first design approaches to real-world projects. The training also helped me improve my understanding of usability, visual hierarchy, consistency, and user-centered problem solving through practical design exercises and projects.

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Ride Buddy </h3>
<p>
  RideBuddy was designed to address common problems in everyday commuting, such as difficulty finding nearby rides, lack of clarity in ride details, and complex booking flows in existing ride-sharing applications. The goal of the project was to create a seamless and intuitive experience that allows users to discover, evaluate, and book rides with minimal effort.

The design process involved understanding user pain points related to trust, speed, and usability in ride-sharing platforms. Based on these insights, the solution focuses on simplified user flows, clear ride information, and a clean interface that guides users naturally through the journey from ride discovery to confirmation. A mobile-first approach was adopted to ensure accessibility and ease of use for daily commuters.

RideBuddy highlights skills in problem definition, user-centered design, information hierarchy, and high-fidelity UI design, making it a strong portfolio project that demonstrates practical UX decision-making and modern design execution.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
LST: LST at SURE Trust is about character, ethics, and mindset. Since the organization has roots in values-based education these sessions likely taught you:

Personality Branding: I didn't just learn to make a resume; I learned how to present "the best version of myself" to the world.

Lateral Thinking: In UI/UX, there is never just one solution. LST taught you how to think outside the box to solve user problems in ways others might miss.

The Spirit of Service: I learned that your work as a designer has a social impact. It’s not just about business; it’s about making life easier for people (especially rural or underserved users).

Resilience & Discipline: SURE Trust is known for being strict. LST helped you build the mental toughness to handle pressure, meet deadlines, and stay committed even when the work got hard.

SST: If LST was about who I am, SST was about how I interact. For a UI/UX designer, these are the skills that get your designs approved:

The Art of Communication: I learned that being a great designer is useless if I can't explain my ideas. SST taught me how to speak clearly, listen actively, and present my prototypes with confidence.

Mock Interviews & Grooming: I likely practiced how to handle tough questions and how to dress and behave in a professional setting.

Feedback Management: In UI/UX, "critique" is part of the job. SST taught me how to take constructive criticism without taking it personally—using it to improve your design instead.
